## Stock Market Analysis and Prediction using LSTM

### Introduction:

Time Series data is a series of data points indexed in time order. Time series data is everywhere, so manipulating them is important for any data analyst or data scientist.

 we will discover and explore data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft). We will learn how to use yfinance to get stock information, and visualize different aspects of it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method!

Traditionally most machine learning (ML) models use as input features some observations (samples / examples) but there is no time dimension in the data.

Time-series forecasting models are the models that are capable to predict future values based on previously observed values. Time-series forecasting is widely used for non-stationary data. Non-stationary data are called the data whose statistical properties e.g. the mean and standard deviation are not constant over time but instead, these metrics vary over time.

These non-stationary input data (used as input to these models) are usually called time-series. Some examples of time-series include the temperature values over time, stock price over time, price of a house over time etc. So, the input is a signal (time-series) that is defined by observations taken sequentially in time.

The LSTM model
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points (e.g. images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video inputs).
LSTM models are able to store information over a period of time.
